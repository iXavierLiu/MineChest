## What is MineChest
MineChest is a Minecraft server chest plugin for auto-classification and auto-sorting.
MineChest aims to provide players with a more convenient way to store and organize items using chests without destroying the game experience.
This plugin has no database and configuration files, you only need to put MineChest.jar under plugins in the server directory to use it easily.

## Auto-sorting
When you open the box, all items will be neatly arranged in your box without any operation.

## Others
Other features coming soon.
